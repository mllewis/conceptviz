-> A foundational assumptino about language is that when I say a word - like bread - it brings to mind roughly same representation in your mind as mind,k and similiar representaitons across people

ANd, while some version of this assumption is very likely to be true, it's difficult to interrogate because we only coarse grain representations of meaning are observable.

We propose using hand drawings as a window into studying cross-cultural variability in conceptual represnations

In particular, we make use of a dataset collected by google - quick draw -

that include 50 million drawings of various concrete nouns - bread, tree, mountain, sun, etc.) by over 15 million participations across the world

-> To quantify the similarity of drawings to eachother, we used a geometric measure callued hasusdorf distance, which is the minimun distance between two sets of points.

We validated this measure of similarity by comparing it to human judgements

We took two categories - bread and tree - and divided pairs of them into different quintiles based on their hassdorf distance - and human judgements were relatively highly correlated.

-> We next asked how drawings from participants of different cultural background compared to eachother. 

Here's the prototype for the “bread” drawing for each country [calculated as the drawing with the smallest average pairwise distance to other drawings from the same country], 

and when you compare these drawing across countries a highly sensible pattern emerges, with participants from countries that inutitively seem relatively more similair to eachother producing drawings that are also more similiar to eacthoerh/

-> Finally, we tried to predict variability in drawings with cross linguistic varability in semantic space. 

We compared the mean similiarity of drawings of 40 different items between countries
to the similarity of word meanings in  the primary langauges spoken in each country, using word embedding models.

What we found was that languages that had relatively more similiar semantics, also had relatively more similiar drawings - 
suggesting non loinguistioc represntation is predicted by linguistic community

-> Moving forward, were thinking about how to characterize difference across sematnic domains, and compare linguistic similarity to other measures of cultural
